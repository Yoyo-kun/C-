This tutorial is based on the content of Marc Gregoire's Professional C++, 4th Edition. There may be some errors. Please correct them.

Because of my poor English, concerned about misunderstandings, I could just learn the edition with Chinese translation.When I finish it, I will learn the last 6th Edition.

Update approximately once a week.

大约每周更新一次。
